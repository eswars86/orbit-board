> A lightweight, open-source **Kanban board** for teams — by **OrbitLabs**.

OrbitBoard is a small, friendly task board you can self-host in minutes. Organise
work into columns, drop cards where they belong, and keep your team in sync — no
heavyweight setup, no external database required to get started.

It's part of the [OrbitLabs](https://github.com/OrbitLabs) family of developer
productivity tools, built and maintained by a community of contributors. 💚

## ✨ Features

- 📋 **Boards & columns** — organise work into visual lanes.
- 🃏 **Cards** — lightweight tasks you can create and move.
- ⚡ **Fast** — React + Vite front end, Express API back end.
- 🗂️ **Zero-DB start** — data lives in a local JSON file, so you can run it instantly.
- 🔌 **REST API** — clean, documented endpoints (see [`docs/api.md`](./docs/api.md)).
- 🧩 **Hackable** — small codebase, easy to read and extend.

> 🚧 OrbitBoard is **actively being built (~50% complete)**. Some features are
> intentionally open for contribution — see [Good first issues](#-good-first-issues).

## 🚀 Quick start

```bash
# 1. Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/orbit-board.git
cd orbit-board

# 2. Use the right Node version
nvm use            # reads .nvmrc (Node 18)

# 3. Install everything (root + server + client)
npm run install:all

# 4. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env      # Windows: copy .env.example .env

# 5. Seed sample data (optional but nice)
npm run seed

# 6. Run it 🚀
npm run dev
```

Then open **http://localhost:3000** — you should see the board with sample columns.

👉 **Full, detailed instructions live in [`SETUP.md`](./SETUP.md).** If you hit a
snag, that's where the answers are.

## 🐣 Good first issues

OrbitBoard is a great place to make your first open-source contribution:

- ⏳ **Drag-and-drop** between columns is not implemented yet.
- ⏳ **Card editing** is currently read-only.
- 🐛 **Deleting a card throws an error** — a well-contained bug, perfect for a
  first fix. (The app still runs fine otherwise.)

See [`docs/faq.md`](./docs/faq.md) and the **Issues** tab for details.
